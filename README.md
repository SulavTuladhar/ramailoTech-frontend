This project is a full-stack web application for managing blog posts. It includes both the backend and frontend components, implemented using Express and React respectively. The backend is built using the FastAPI framework, providing a RESTful API for CRUD operations on blog posts, categories, and tags. User authentication and authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The frontend is developed using React, providing various components/pages for interacting with the blog posts, including listing recent posts, displaying post details, creating/updating posts, browsing categories and tags, and managing user authentication.
